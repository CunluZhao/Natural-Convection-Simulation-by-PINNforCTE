This repository contains the source code for the natural convection simulation with PINNforCTE. The codes can be opened in TensorFlow for checking and running. Each file corresponds to the case of a specific Ra number. To run the codes, the readers should note the following three aspects of the neural network:
a) The network size is 6×100 (i.e., number of hidden layers × number of neurons per layer), as is described in Section 3.1.1 of the paper and implemented in the net function of the source code.
b) We used the Adam and L-BFGS algorithms for the network training. In the first stage of training, the Adam optimization algorithm was used for the initial 30,000 iterations. The learning rate was set to 1×10⁻³ for the first 10,000 steps, 1×10⁻⁴ for the second 10,000 steps, and 5×10⁻⁵ for the last 10,000 steps. In the second stage of training, the L-BFGS algorithm was used with a self-adjustable learning rate. These details are provided in Section 3.1 of the paper and implemented within the model function of the source code.
c) Concerning the activation functions, we used the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function throughout the work, as mentioned in Section 2.3 of the paper and implemented in the net function of the code.
Users can use these codes to reproduce the results in our paper titled "Modeling Natural Convection by Solving Conservative Transport Equations with Physics-Informed Neural Networks".
